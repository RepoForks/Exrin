# Frequently Asked Questions

1. Is this another MVVM Framework?
Yes and no. You can use this with any other MVVM Framework, or use what is available in Exrin.

2. What IoC does it use?
None, you inject your own IoC and DI Framework when configuring your app. After using a few on different project, I prefer AutoFac.

3. Does this have any dependencies?
No. That was a critical design point. Exrin does not depend on anything. Having a package that locks you into another package version has become increasing frustrating and Exrin will not be a part of that.
