Enterprise Xamarin Forms Framework

Enterprise or high quality xamarin apps require a lot of code just to ensure errors are handled correctly, it is easily unit testable and the app stays responsive and always actionable to the user.

If you have a larger team, enforcing standards also becomes difficult, the less a developer has to remember the easier it will be

It is designed around being highly unit testable. Unit tests are the only way to continuously ensure your application remains of high quality.

This framework is designed to be used with any other MVVM framework and will be designed to work regardless of Xamarin Version (though still working some of those details out).

This is still very much conceptual at the moment and the project may just end in tears, but an attempt will be made.
