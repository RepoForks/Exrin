Enterprise Xamarin Forms Framework

This is a project I keep thinking about, attempt, relent, then try again. After a few weeks and lots of scribbled notes I though its time to give it a proper shot. This is from my learnings of 4 enterprise level projects over 1.5 years. (6 months, 9 months, 3 months, and one in progress). And also 3 other XF consumer applications I did for others after work and weekends. And also on my learnings of writing the xarch-starter project.

This is not another MVVM framework, it sits on top of any MVVM framework. Something I will test. And its no where near complete yet, its completely broken at the moment so if you stumble across here check back later. :)

Enterprise or high quality xamarin apps require a lot of code just to ensure errors are handled correctly, application insights are recorded, transactions, easily unit testable and the app stays responsive and always actionable to the user.

If you have a larger team, enforcing standards also becomes difficult, the less a developer has to remember the easier it will be. Creating something to enforce those standards has typically been hard.

This framework is designed to be used with any other MVVM framework and will be designed to work regardless of Xamarin Version (though still working some of those details out).

This is still very much conceptual at the moment and the project may just end in tears, but an attempt will be made.

Main goal is to make this really easy to implement, understand and use, otherwise this project will fail. If it ends up like the Microsoft Enterprise Libraries then I know I have failed.
